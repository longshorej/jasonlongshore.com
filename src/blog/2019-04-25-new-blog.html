  <h3>New Blog!</h3>
  <div class="when">April 25th</div>

  <p>I've been meaning to start one of these again after a ten year hiatus. This time
    I think it'll be focused on <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and
    things I've been doing with it.</p>

  <p>For this iteration, I'm particularly interested in how far I can get by using the
  simplest tools possible. In reality, is maintaining a few HTML files really that burdensome?</p>

  <p>For this blog, I'm using a <a href="https://github.com/longshorej/csi">tiny tool</a>
    to produce static HTML files. Let's see how it goes!</p>

  <p>For those interested, the source is on <a href="https://github.com/longshorej/www.jasonlongshore.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
